·      model: random interaction of people and money. Intermediate values are hidden in the function, gradually transition into the end-distribution\> multiple rounds. Stable state\> reach it from different initial points. No matter the distribution of people: fulfill requirement that money in total don’t have to change. Integration to get area under the curve could represent the money amount.

·      simplify the situation for a simulation: In minimum we need 3 people. The minimum unit is 1\$. Total wealth is 6\$. Every person starts with 2\$ at the beginning. What are all possible configurations of wealth? Only 7 possible states: 222, 123, 114, 033, 024, 015, 006. These seven states ignore the order of the numbers. Microstates= possible configurations, with respect to order (f.e. for 123: 132, 213, 231, 312, 321).

·      simulation regarding only three states: system can only be in one state of those three. S1, S2, S3. F.e. S1 can stay in S1 or go to S2 or go to S3. How likely is it, that the system remains in his state? What makes a state unlikely? Two people exchange money: from state 222 you can end up in 222 (keep money), 213, 231, 240, 204. 20% probability that it would stay the same state and 40% probability that the state will switch. Then repeat it with other two people. Afterwards repeat whole scenario with another state. Most likely stages: 123, 024. It is much more difficult to get a lot of money, than to get little.
